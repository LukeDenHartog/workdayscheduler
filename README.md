## Working on this project involved me researching how to use different application programing interfaces (APIs). 
I had to look through the documentation for Day.js to add the current date to the header.
I also searched through jQuery documentation in order to add and or remove class names in order to make the page's hour slot colors dynamic.
I got some much needed practice using APIs and have a much better grasp on how to set/get data from local storage.

    If anyone would like to work on/add to this project it is recommended to first follow these steps:
- Download Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Pull the files from my GitHub Profile Repository: https://github.com/LukeDenHartog/workdayscheduler
- It is recommended to have to latest version of Google Chrome which can be found here: https://www.google.com/chrome/.
- Get some basic understanding on a couple APIs like: Bootstrap, jQuery, and Day.js.

## Usage
 This project (https://LukeDenHartog.github.io/workdayscheduler/) displays a web based program that allows you to input criteria for each hour of the workday.
 It also displays/monitors the time of day and has a dynamic color display depending on the current hour. My favorite feature is that it saves the text you type into the timeslots in the local storage.
	This project was very useful and I'll be adding it to my github to display some experience I gained using jQuery and Day.js to any viewers of my github page. If any users have any questions about how to use this webpage they can reach me at lukeadenhartog@gmail.com.
